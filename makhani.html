	<h3> Introduction:</h3>
	<p> This famous <span>Indian dish </span>was invented in Delhi in the 1940s and quickly became popular in other parts of the world thanks to its creamy quality and mild spice intensity, which made it very palatable for people who weren't used to the heat of some <span>traditional Indian dishes </span>but who craved the <span>flavor of foreign spices</span>. Even though it's called <span>butter chicken</span> there isn't actually too much butter in it; it gets its name from the tender, buttery flavor of the chicken and the creamy sauce that covers it.
