	<p>Rinse shredded potatoes in cold water; drain well, squeezing to remove excess water. Place in a large bowl. Stir in egg, flour, onion, salt and pepper.</p>
	
	<p>In a large nonstick skillet, heat 1/4 in. oil over medium heat. Working in batches, drop potato mixture by 1/3 cupfuls into oil; press to flatten slightly. Fry both sides until golden brown; drain on paper towels. Serve immediately. If desired, sprinkle with parsley and top with applesauce and sour cream.</p>
